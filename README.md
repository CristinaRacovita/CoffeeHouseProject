# Coffee House Delivery App
What I used:
- Implicit intent (for opening in the browser the location of the cafe house, when you press the map image).
- Explicit intent (by pressing a button for change the activities).
- Time Picker (for setting the delivery hour by client).
- Edit Text Constraints (the order can't be placed if all the fields are incomplete).
- Toast Message (when you press on one of specialities that you want to buy, a message will appear).
- Spinner (client phone number).
- Alert Dialog (for order confirmation).
- Scroll View (for FAQ activity).
- Menu (shortcut for cart, and contact information).
- Ancenstral Navigation (back to main page).
- Floating Button (for placed order and empty the cart).
- Radio Buttons (for choosing the delivery method).

# Introduction
You can pick what and how much you want by Criss Specialities. Also, after you decide what to order, you can complete your personal information and place the order. A receipt will be generated after you pick the delivery hour. In this receipt are mentioned: your datas, what you want to order and how much these cost. If you want to contact the cafe house, you need to press the contact button from the main page menu. The contact page shows you the facebook and instagram account of the cafe. To find more easier the place you can press the image of the map and a browser will be opening with the exact location. For generic questions, the cafe has a page where the administrators answer to some basic questions.
