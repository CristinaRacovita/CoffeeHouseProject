# Introduction
You can choose the products you want to buy from the existing cafe house. To place a order you need to complete some personal information. A receipt is generated after you pick the delivery hour. This receipt mentioned: your data, order products and the order price. If you want to contact the cafe house, you need to press the contact button from the main page menu. The contact page shows you the facebook and instagram account of the cafe. For generic questions, the cafe has a page where the admins answer to the most common questions.
